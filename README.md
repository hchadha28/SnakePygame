# 🐍 Retro Snake Game (Python + Pygame)

A modern take on the classic **Snake Game**, built with Python and Pygame.
This project was created to explore **game development fundamentals** — game loops, event handling, collision detection, and object-oriented design.

- **High Score** tracking (stored permanently)  
- Minimal retro UI design with borders, title, and sounds
